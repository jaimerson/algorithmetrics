Algorithmetrics
----------

This project is intended to measure the efficiency of a series of algorithms.

Please note that these are na√Øve implementations of methods already existent
in Ruby's standard lib.

## Charts

Here's the chart comparing binary (iterative and recursive) and linear search
algorithms:

And, as the difference between iterative and recursive binary search isn't
obvious there, here's a version comparing those two:
